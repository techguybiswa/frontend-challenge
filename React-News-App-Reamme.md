<h1>News App React</h1>

<h3>Problem Story</h3>
<p>
So in my smartphone I had 3 apps: One is BBC News app, one is TechCrunch News app and the other is Wired News App.
For tech news I check TechCrunch/Wired News App and for sports news I check BBC App.
But my phone was running short on memory so I had to delete BBC News :(
</p>

<h3>Solution with the News App </h3>

<p>
So to solve the need of multiple apps to access news from multiple sources I built this News App.
You can search for any news , be it sports or technology and then you can filter by source.
So if you want football news form BBC UK or latest startup funding news from TechCrunch, you can get all of it in this one single app.

<h3>Technical Features</h3>

Before going further I would request you all to go through this video: <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/07376b465fec4fe882ac92aff714c3ce">Demo Video</a>


<ul>
  <li><b>Search for news as you type: </b> As the user types the query in the search bar all the relevant news get rendered below with a debounce of 500 ms. </li>
  <li><b>Filter by news source: </b> The user can choose multiple sources or single source to filter the news. So if the user wants to see startup news from TechCrunch and Wired then the user can type "startup" in the search box and select "TechCrunch" and "Wired" from the dropdown </li>
  <li><b>Default view top headlines: </b> When no query is provided the user will see top headlines of UK </li>
  <li><b>Sticky Search Bar and filter : </b> In the previous design the search bar was not only visible on scroll to top. To me it seemed that a sticky search bar will provide a much better user experience as the user now will not have to scroll to top again and again to change the filters or search query.</li>
    <li><b>Responsive Design: </b> The design has been made. As you can see in the demo video that teh elements readjust to the changing width.  Responsiveness imporves <b>SEO</b> and <b>Accessibility</b></li>

  
  
  
</ul>
