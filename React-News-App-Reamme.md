<h1>News App React</h1>

<h3>Problem Story</h3>
<p>
So in my smartphone I had 3 apps: One is BBC News app, one is TechCrunch News app and the other is Wired News App.
For tech news I check TechCrunch/Wired News App and for sports news I check BBC App.
But my phone was running short on memory so I had to delete BBC News :(

<h3>Solution with the News App </h3>

<p>
So to solve the need of multiple apps to access news from multiple sources I built this News App.
You can search for any news , be it sports or technology and then you can filter by source.
So if you want football news form BBC UK or latest startup fundings from TechCrunch you can simply use my news app!
