## Analytics Design

For an app like ours, we need to track KPIs like DAU, MAU, DAU/MAU ratio, sessions length and others.

The list of analytics I will track are:

1.DAU or Daily Active USers: We need to track the number of unique users that are using our app in a daily basis. The reason we need this is keep a track of the growth.

2. MAU or Monthly Active Users: Another important KPI is MAU where we keep a track of number of unique users on a period of 30 days. Also the DAU to MAU ratio will give us an idea of the stickiness of the app.

3. Session Length: We can also track the session length of each user to get an idea of how intriguing our app is.

4. Filter Value Count: We should also track as of which source is getting selected how many times. In this way if there is a source that users are not using much we can remove it from the app.

5. Search Track : We can also keep a track of how many search are getting done by the user. And more importantly we can track how many "No article" result we are getting. In this way we can understand if the user is getting results for their queries.

6. Filter Use Copunt: Also another aspect to track will be to see how many times the source filter is getting used. If people are not using it, tehn maybe we can try experiemneting with a differnent filter.
